Unofficial Self-Contained Sigil Package/Installer for Linux
===========================================================

Goal: to provide a self-contained binary installer for Sigil that works on any Linux system with a libc version of 2.19 or higher (ldd --version).


Please note that "self-contained" does not mean portable or relocatable!!

NOTE: some people are reporting installer-script syntax errors when using various shells. Until I make some changes to make the shell-script more "portable," try explicitly using a bash shell to launch the installer. Using the skiplibctest argument as described in the [trouble-shooting section of the INSTALL documentation](./INSTALL.md#troubleshooting) (if you're certain your libc is recent enough) may work around the issue as well.
